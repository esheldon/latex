\title{A Photometric Redshift Catalog for SDSS DR8}

\input{authors.tex}

\begin{abstract}

We present a catalog of photometric redshifts for galaxies in the SDSS DR8
imaging data.  We use the algorithm presented in \citet{LimaPhotoz08} and
\citet{CunhaPhotoz09} to derive the overall redshift distribution \Nofz\ for
galaxies with \rmag$ < $\rmax.  In this technique, weights are derived for the
training set galaxies such that their density distribution in color-magnitude
space is proportional to that of the photometry-only sample. The \Nofz\ of the
photometric sample is then estimated by constructing a weighted histogram of
the training set redshifts.  We also use this same method to derive redshift
probability distributions \pofz\ for individual galaxies.  The \pofz\ summed
over all galaxies is similar but not identical to the redshift distribution of
the overall sample. We apply a correction to the individual \pofz\ so that the
summed \pofz\ equals the estimated \Nofz.  We expect the primary source of
error is sample variance: the training sets are drawn from relatively small
volumes of space.  Using simulations we calculate the uncertainty in \Nofz\ at
a given redshift is $\sim$ \localbias.  The uncertainty on calculations using
\Nofz\ or \pofz\ depend on the details; we discuss the case of weak lensing
measurements.  The \pofz\ catalog is available for download through the SDSS
website.  

%The \pofz\ should be used with care, and we describe their
%proper use in detail.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Photometric redshifts are estimates of redshift derived using broad-band
photometric observables such as magnitudes and colors.  Typically, the set of
observables for a given galaxy are not sufficient to uniquely specify its
redshift, but only a probability distribution, the \pofz.  These \pofz\ are
often relatively broad. For simplicity of use and interpretation, one commonly
uses a single-number, the photometric redshift as the best estimate of a
galaxy's redshift.  As several recent works have shown
\citep{man08,CunhaPhotoz09,wit09,bor10,abr11}, the use of single-number
photo-zs is a biased approach to redshift estimation.  Working with the full
\pofz\ for each galaxy yields better estimates of the overall redshift
distribution, $N(z)$, and can decrease biases in cosmological analysis.  We
note that several public photo-z codes exist that can output \pofz s, e.g.
{\it Le Phare} \citep{arn99,ilb06}, {\it ZEBRA} \citep{fel06}, {\it BPZ} \citep{coe06}, {\it
ArborZ} \citep{ger10}, and our own nameless method \citep{CunhaPhotoz09}.


In this paper, we describe a \pofz\ catalog for the SDSS DR8.  We use the
method of \citet{CunhaPhotoz09}, which was also applied to SDSS DR7, with
improvements in the training set and  photometry.  The DR7 catalog of
\cite{CunhaPhotoz09} has been succesfully used in cosmological analysis,
allowing, for example, for the  first measurement of the angular BAO scale
derived purely from angular information, i.e. without using the 3D power-spectrum
\citep{car11}% {\color{red} what about Padmanabhan?} {\color{blue} (I copied this statement from the abstract. I emailed Carnero to check.)} and for the measurement of

This paper is organized as follows ...

\section{Method} \label{sec:method}

The algorithm is detailed in \citet{LimaPhotoz08} and \citet{CunhaPhotoz09}.
The method derives weights for a training set of spectroscopically confirmed
galaxies such that the distribution of relevant quantities, such as magnitudes
or colors, matches that of a %secondary 
set of galaxies without known redshifts, henceforth the photometric sample.
Assuming these quantities correlate with redshift, and are the only relevant
quantities for redshift determination, the resulting weighted redshift
histogram is proportional to the redshift %probability 
distribution \Nofz\ of the photometric sample. 

\subsection{Nearest-neighbor \pofz\ redshift estimators}\label{sec:nnpz}

\subsubsection{Weights}

In this section, we briefly review the weighting method\footnote{The weights and \pofz\
codes are available at {\url http://kobayashi.physics.lsa.umich.edu/~ ccunha/nearest/}} of \cite{LimaPhotoz08}, which
is required for computing \pofz.  We define the weight, $w$, of a galaxy in
the spectroscopic training set as the normalized ratio of the density of
galaxies in the photometric sample to the density of training-set galaxies
around the given galaxy.  These densities are calculated in a local
neighborhood in the space of photometric observables, e.g., multi-band
magnitudes.  In this case, the DES {\it griz} magnitudes are our observables.
The hypervolume used to estimate the density is set here to be the Euclidean
distance of the galaxy to its $100^{th}$ nearest-neighbor in the training set.

The weights can be used to estimate the redshift distribution of the
photometric sample:
\begin{equation}  
\nwei = \sum_{\beta=1}^{N_{\rm T}} w_\beta \delta(z-z_\beta)~.
\label{eqn:Nzest}
\end{equation}
\begin{comment}
\begin{equation}  
\nwei = \sum_{\beta=1}^{N_{\rm T,tot}} w_\beta N(z_1<z_\beta<z_2)_{\rm T},
\label{eqn:Nzest}
\end{equation}
\end{comment}

\noindent For a bin $z_1 < z < z_2$, we sum the weights of all training
set galaxies that fall within that bin.  
Ref.~\cite{LimaPhotoz08,CunhaPhotoz09} show that this indeed provides
a nearly unbiased estimate of the redshift distribution of the photometric
sample, $N(z)_{\rm P}$, provided the differences in the selection of the
training and photometric samples are solely in the observable quantities used
to calculate the weights.  For example, if the photometric sample
has some sort of shape dependent cut, the same cut should be applied to the
training sample or shape should be one of the observables used to measure
weights.


\subsubsection{\pofz}

To estimate the redshift error distribution for each galaxy, \pofz,
we adopt the method of \cite{CunhaPhotoz09}. The \pofz\ for a given object in the
photometric sample is simply the redshift distribution of the N (in this case
100) nearest-neighbors in the {\bf training} set:

\begin{equation}
\hat{P}(z) = \sum_{\beta=1}^{N_{\rm nei}} w_\beta \delta(z-z_\beta)~.
\label{eqn:pzest}
\end{equation}

\noindent This is the same as Eqn. \ref{eqn:Nzest} but limited to the nearest
neighbors of a given object. We estimate \pofz\ in 35 redshift bins between
$z=0$ and 1.1.  We can also construct a new estimator for $N(z)_{\rm P}$ by
summing the $\hat{P}(z)$ distributions for all galaxies in the photometric
sample,


\begin{equation}
\npz = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm P,tot}}\hat{p}_i(z)~.
\label{eqn:Nhat2}
\end{equation}
\noindent This estimator becomes identical to that of Eqn. (\ref{eqn:Nzest})
in the limit of very large training sets.  For training sets smaller than tens
of thousands of galaxies, one can improve the \pofz s by multiplying each \pofz\ by the
ratio of $\nwei$ to $\npz$.
That is,
\begin{equation}
P(z) \rightarrow P(z)\frac{\nwei}{\npz} \label{eqn:pzcorrect}
\end{equation}
This correction essentially corresponds to using the weights estimate as a
prior on the \pofz s.



\section{Photometric Data}

The photometric data were drawn from data release 8 (DR8) of the Sloan Digitial
Sky Survey III.  Full details are given in the data release paper \citet{dr8}.
As compared to the earlier DR7 release, DR8 includes an additional 2500
deg$^2$ of new imaging in the Southern Galactic Cap (SGC), %. These data were
taken to facilitate spectroscopic target selection for the \boss\ experiment,
which is part of SDSS III.


SDSS data are gathered using the 2.5 meter at Apache Point \citep{Gunn06} with
the camera \citep{Gunn98} in time-delay-and-integrate mode.  Observations are
taken in each of the SDSS bandpasses {\it ugriz} nearly simultaneously as the
sky drifts across the camera.  The data were taken during photometric nights
under relatively good seeing conditions \citep{Hogg01}.  A series of pipelines
are run to calibrate the data \citep{Nikhil08,Smith02,Tucker06}, derive
astrometry \citep{Pier03}, and calculate fluxes, shapes and other interesting
quantities \citep{LuptonADASS01}.  Note the calibration used for these data are
derived using the ``ubercalibration'' technique presented in \citet{Nikhil08}.

\section{Photometric Quantities} \label{sec:photo}

In this section we describe the photometric quantities used in creation of the
\photoz\ catalog.  Most of these quantities are measured by the SDSS
photometric pipeline \photo. An early version of the pipeline is described in
\citet{LuptonADASS01}.  Other details can be found in the SDSS Data Release
papers, e.g. \citet{dr4} and at the SDSS III website \citep{sdssorg}.  We will
give a few additional details below.

For colors we use the SDSS ``model magnitudes'', which we will refer to as
\modelmag\ \citep{dr7photo}.  Each object is fit to an elliptical exponential
disk, an elliptical \devauc\ profile, and a PSF model determined by
interpolating the PSF to the location of the
object \citep{LuptonADASS01,Sheldon04}.  The exponential and \devauc\ models are
convolved with the local PSF.  For the \modelmag, the best fit model in the
\rmag\ band is then used to extract the flux in the other four bandpasses,
accounting appropriately for the PSF in each band. Thus the effective aperture
is the same for all bands, which is appropriate for extraction of color
information.

We use ``composite model magnitudes'' as an approximate total magnitude for
each object, which we will refer to as \cmodelmag.  For each bandpass
separately, the flux from the best-fitting exponential and \devauc\ models are
combined:
\begin{equation}
\textrm{Flux}_{cmodel} \equiv (1-f_{dev})\times \textrm{Flux}_{exp} + f_{dev} \times \textrm{Flux}_{dev}
\end{equation}
where $f_{dev}$ is the fraction of the total flux estimated to come from a
\devauc\ profile\citep{dr7photo}.  Note the aperture for each band is
different, so these magnitudes are not appropriate for estimating colors.

For quality assurance, we use bits from the \texttt{OBJECT} bitmask output by
\photo.  See \citet{dr7flags} for detailed information about the flags.    We
also use the \texttt{RESOLVE\_STATUS} \citep{dr7resolve} to choose primary
observations.  We will describe how the flags are used in section \S \ref{sec:select}.


\begin{comment}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{SATUR}  The object contains saturated pixels.
  \item \texttt{BRIGHT} The object is very bright and must be remeasured.
  \item \texttt{DEBLEND\_TOO\_MANY\_PEAKS}
\end{itemize}
\end{comment}
    

\section{Photometric Sample Selection} \label{sec:select}

\subsection{Star Galaxy Separation}

The \photo\ pipeline uses the concentration $c$ to separate stars from
galaxies.  The concentration is the difference between magnitude determined
from the best fitting PSF model \psfmag\ and the best overall fitting model 
\modelmag\ which may or may not be the PSF model.
\begin{equation}
c \equiv \textrm{psfmag} - \textrm{modelmag}
\end{equation}
Because the exponential and \devauc\ models are convolved with the PSF, the
concentration should be $\ge 0$ within the noise, with stars close to zero and
galaxies greater than zero.  The pipeline defines galaxies as objects with $c >
0.145$ \citep{dr7classify} where $c$ is derived from the summed fluxes from all
bandpasses.  

At our magnitude limit $r = $\rmax, the contamination is may be relatively
large.  Using a small spaced based data set, the stellar contamination is a few
percent at \rmag\ = 21 but increases to approximately \contamworst\ at \rmag\ =
22\footnote{http://www.sdss.org/DR7/products/general/stargalsep.html}.  In
practice the end user should perform more strict cuts on the data to choose a
subset that suits their needs.

For studies where completeness and purity must be known precisely,
\citet{ScrantonMag05} recommend using probabilistic star galaxy separation at
fainter mags (\rmag\ $ > $ 21); i.e.  attempt to determine the {\it probability}
that an object is a galaxy and either use that as a weight or make appropriate
cuts. We provide a catalog here that should be a superset of objects that can
be further trimmed.

\subsection{Other Cuts}

We remove objects for which the extinction-corrected model flux is not well
determined in at least one of the bands.  The magnitude limits are [21, 22, 22,
20.5, 20.1] for \allmag\ respectively.

In addition to the magnitude limits described above, which only demand a
reasonable detection in at least one band, we additionally demand that we have
detections in both the \rmag\ and \imag\ bands.  Rather than applying a
magnitude cut, we instead use the \texttt{OBJECT} processing flags
\texttt{BINNED}\{1,2,4\}, which indicate the object was detected in the original
image (binned by 1), the 2X2 binned image, or the 4x4 binned image respectively.

We remove all objects that are found to have the following \texttt{OBJECT}
flags set: \texttt{SATUR}, \texttt{BRIGHT}, \texttt{DEBLEND\_TOO\_MANY\_PEAKS},
\texttt{PEAKCENTER}, \texttt{NOTCHECKED}, \texttt{NOPROFILE} as well as objects
that are (\texttt{BLENDED} \&\& \texttt{NODEBLEND}); in other words, detected
to be blended but not successfully deblended into components. 

We only use objects marked as \texttt{SURVEY\_PRIMARY} in their
\texttt{RESOLVE\_STATUS} flags field \citep{dr7resolve}. Different scans on the
sky observe the same objects due to the small overlap regions between adjacent
scans, overlaps at the end of the scan lines where the great circles converge,
and re-observed scan lines.  This results in duplicate observations for many
objects.  These duplicates are ``resolved'' and only a single observation is
kept.

We demand the extinction corrected \citep{Schlegel98} \cmodelmag\ in the \rmag\
band is in the range [\rmin, \rmax].  We also restrict the ordinary \modelmag\
to be within the range [\modelrmin, \modelrmax] in order to ensure reasonable
colors for the galaxies.

We make broad geometrical cuts on the catalog.  We trim the objects to the
\boss\ footprint, shown in figure \ref{fig:footprint}. We also remove any
objects near stars in the tycho2 catalog \citep{tycho2} using a variable radius
that depends on the magnitude of the star:
\begin{equation}
r = (0.0802\times B_T^2 - 1.860\times B_T + 11.625)/60.0
\end{equation}
where $B_T$ is the Tycho magnitude and $r$ is in degrees.  Finally, we remove
all objects from images taken where a \umag\ amplifier was not working.

\end{figure}

The final photometric catalog contains \nphoto\ objects.  The distribution of
extinction corrected \rmag-band \cmodelmag\ and colors derived from extinction
corrected \modelmag\ are shown in \ref{fig:varhist}.

\section{Training Samples} \label{sec:train}

We use a spectroscopic trining set drawn from a number of sources. These
sources contain mostly galaxies and a small number of stars in order to help
characterize stellar contaminants from the photometric sample at low redshift.
In the following sections we give short details on each sample and describe our
process for matching to the photometric sample.

\subsection{Matching to SDSS Imaging Data} \label{sec:train:match}

We match by position the training sets listed in \S \ref{sec:train:def} to the
photometric catalog described in \S \ref{sec:select}.  We choose the closest
match within \matchrad.  By performing this match we place the training set
galaxies on the same photometric system as the photometric set.  We also
guarantee that the matches are drawn from the same magnitude range, and
have the same quality cuts applied, as the photometric set.

As noted in \S \ref{sec:train:def}, the training sets contain some stars.
There are also some stars in the photometric set, since the star galaxy
separation is not perfect.  Thus, through this matching between photometric set
and training set it should be possible to place some fraction of the stars in
the photometric set at redshift zero; or at least some part of their derived
\pofz.

\section{Results}

We use the algorithm described in \S \ref{sec:method} to derive weights for
each training set galaxy.  We then use these weights to calculate a weighted
redshift histogram which, under our assumptions, should be proportional to that
of the training set.  We also derive individual redshift probability
distributions \pofz\ for each photometric galaxy.

\subsection{Derived Weights in Observable Space}

The \rmag-band \cmodelmag\ and colors based on \modelmag\ for the photometric
and training sets are shown in figure \ref{fig:varhist}.  Also shown are the
derived weights for the training set and the resulting weighted histograms.
These are the fundamentally new calculations we present in this work.

The weighted training set distributions should be approximately proportional to
the photometric set distributions in order to derive good redshift
distributions.  There are deviations at \gmr\ $\sim 1.5$ and \rmi\ $\sim 0.6$,
but qualitatively the distributions are close.  It may be possible to learn
something by comparing these distributions directly, but we will instead focus
on the accuracy of the recovered redshift distributions.

    Also shown is the weighted histogram for the training sample where
    the weights are derived to produced distributions approximately 
    proportional to the photometric sample.

    \modelmag.  The bottom right panel shows the distribution of of the
    derived weights for the training sample. }
    \label{fig:varhist}

    \vspace{2em}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Derived \Nofz}

Figure \ref{fig:pofz} shows the recovered redshift distribution for the entire
\rmag\ $<$ \rmax\ sample.  Also shown is the redshift distribution of the
original training set.  These distributions are in qualitative agreement with
those shown in \citet{CunhaPhotoz09}, although that sample had a fainter \rmag\
limit at 22.0.  Note the sub-plot showing the region near $z=0$.  As expected
there is some fraction of the overall distribution near z=0.  The fraction of
at $z < 0.002$ is about 0.4\%.  It is not known exactly how many stars are in
the photometric sample, but this is probably a lower limit on the stellar
contamination {\color{red}beef this up}.  We will estimate the errors on this
distribution in \S \ref{sec:errors}. These \Nofz\ data are presented in Table
\ref{tab:nofz}.


\subsection{Derived \pofz}

Also shown in \ref{fig:pofz} is the summed \pofz\ derived for individual
galaxies.  The(uncorrected) $\npz$\ is, characteristically, slightly more peaked than
than $\nwei$.
In \S \ref{sec:pzcorr} we apply Eq. \ref{eqn:pzcorrect} to correct the \pofz s.
%favors lower redshift than the overall weighted
%redshift histogram, although the expectation value of the redshift is within a
%percent {\color{red} Carlos what was the number?}.  This is suggestive that
%these individual \pofz\ can be used meaningfully on their own.{\color{blue} I don't know that similarity between the redshift distributions is that big a deal. I think it's more a statement about the size of the training set. Plus, we are applying the correction, anyway.}% {\color{red} 
%we need some estimates of the bias for both approaches here.  If we are
%skipping rachel's stuff then we need an alternative.}
%\textcolor{blue}{I think I only compared means of different weights estimates. 
%Also, aren't you applying the correction to the \pofz s? This would make their sum
%identical to that of the weights estimate.}

    \caption{Reconstructed redshift distribution for SDSS galaxies with \rmag\
    $ < $ \rmax.  The overall reconstructed distribution, shown in red, is
    derived by creating a weighted histogram of the training set redshifts as
    described in the text.  Also shown in magenta is the sum of all \pofz\
    derived for individual galaxies.  The unweighted training set redshift
    distribution is shown in blue.  The expected errors on these distributions
    from cosmic variance in the training set is shown in Figure
    \ref{fig:ebars}. The excess at $z \sim 0$ is due to stars in training set
    having signifcant weight; more detail at low redshift is shown in the
    inset.  This excess is at least partly due to the presence of real stars in
    our photometric sample resulting from imperfect star-galaxy separation.
    The fraction of the distribution at $z < 0.002$ is 0.4\%, which is probably
    a lower bound on the stellar contamination.  \label{fig:pofz}}

In figure \ref{fig:rand6pofz} we show 6 randomly chosen \pofz.  Each panel
contains a random \pofz\ drawn from a particular magnitude range in extinction
corrected $r$-band \cmodelmag; these ranges are given in the figure caption.
This figure captures the general trend that the \pofz\ are broader at
fainter magnitudes.

    chosen from a particular magnitude range.  Column-wise from top the
    left these ranges are $[r < 18], [18 < r < 19], [19 < r < 20],

\end{figure}

The uncertainty in individual \pofz s is typically dominated by shot-noise
error.  The scale of both statistical and systematic uncertainties in the
individual \pofz s are strongly correlated with the width of the \pofz\
\citep{CunhaPhotoz09}.  A broader \pofz\ reflects a larger degeneracy in
observable space, and require more training-set objects to characterize.  Fig.
\ref{fig:pzwidth} shows the distribution of objects in the photometric sample
as a function of r-band magnitude and $1-\sigma$ width of the \pofz.  The
contours indicate factor of 2 changes in density.  

We recommend using the $1-\sigma$ or other width measures of the \pofz\ as the
most efficient way to trim the sample for improved precision and accuracy.  The
\pofz\ width should also be a reasonable error estimator for use with other
photo-z methods.  However, we discourage using the peak or some other single
number statistic derived from the \pofz\ as a proxy for redshift. See 
\S \ref{sec:usage} for more details.
\begin{comment} If a single-number photo-z estimate is needed we recommend
using a neural network or nearest-neighbor polynomial based approach
\cite[e.g.][]{Oyaizu08}.  \end{comment}

\subsubsection{Correction to \pofz} \label{sec:pzcorr}

As we will demonstrate in \S \ref{sec:pofp}, the individual \pofz\ appear to be
somewhat less accurate than the overall \Nofz.  We can correct the individual
\pofz\ to agree, in the mean, with the overall \Nofz\ using equation
\ref{eqn:pzcorrect}.  This correction factor is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:pzcorr}.  Note at high z $z > 0.9$ neither the \Nofz\ or the summed
\pofz\ are well constrained, and the correction factor is noisy.  We average
the correction factor for $z > 0.9$ and apply it to all points.

    and the bottom panel is the ratio.  We apply this correction to each of the
    \pofz\ in the release catalog.  Note for $z > 0.9$ the correction is
    averaged and applied to all points.}

\section{Sources of Error} \label{sec:errors}

As detailed in \cite{CunhaPhotoz09}, the derived weights, and inferred \Nofz,
are susceptible to four kinds of training-set selection effects: spectroscopic
failures, large-scale structure bias (sample variance + shot noise in the
training set), and selection in non-photometric observables.  In addition, the
fact that the weights use a non-infinitesimal volume to re-weight the
photometric set can yield a small Eddington bias to the recovered distribution.
And, as mentioned previously, incorrect star-galaxy separation can result in
incompleteness and contamination of the sample.  Because our training set
consists of many different surveys with different characteristics, it is
important to quantify the contribution of each to the overall result.  Table
\ref{tbl:weistats} lists, for each of the surveys comprising the training set,
the number of objects, the approximate area, and the percentage the survey
contributes to the weighted estimate of the overall redshift distribution.
This percentage is calculated by summing up the weights assigned to objects in
each survey and dividing by the sum of weights from the entire training set.


From Table \ref{tbl:weistats}, we see that PRIMUS carries the most weight by a
large margin at 62\%.  Overall, the magnitude limited surveys that reach our
selection depth of \rmax\ - PRIMUS, TKRS, CNOC2, DEEP2-EGS, CFRS, VVDS, and
zCOSMOS - represent about 81$\%$ of the total weight.  
This is desirable,
because it minimizes the risk of bias in our assessment errors in what follows.
The Table also shows that the SDSS MAIN sample ($r<17.8$) contributes only $1.7\%$ of the weights, which
is consistent with the fraction expected from simulations for a flux-limited sample 
to $r<21.8$.
The remainder of the SDSS spectra are LRGs to $r<19.4$, and their contribution to the weights is quite 
reasonable.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\it Large-scale structure: } We expect this to be the main source of
error.  We use galaxy+n-body simulations\footnote{Simulations provided courtesy of Risa Wechsler and
Michael Busha. See \cite{bushasimulations} for details.}
 to estimate the sample variance plus shot
noise uncertainties of the spectroscopic redshift distributions of the training
set.  For simplicity, we only simulate the magnitude limited surveys of the
training set.  In addition, because of the overlap between zCOSMOS and one of
the PRIMUS fields, we neglect the zCOSMOS sample in the error estimation to
simplify the calculation.  This results in a $\sim$10\% increase in the error
bars relative to including zCOSMOS as an independent sample.  The predicted
error bars are overlayed on the simulated overall redshift
distribution in Fig.
\ref{fig:ebars}.  The errors are also given in Table \ref{tab:nofz}. The
uncertainty in the training set redshift distributions is not identical to that
of the uncertainties in the estimated redshift distributions N(z) derived using
the weights, hence the error bars should be used only for a reasonable
reference.  A more detailed estimation of the errors would require SDSS
specific photometry+n-body simulations.  Relative to the error bars in the
training set, the error bars in the weighted N(z) should be (very roughly)
about 20-30\% smaller, with increased anti-correlations between neighboring
bins, but to be certain would require more detailed investigation.
%There are also 
We explore these issues in more detail for a different data set
in \citet{CunhaPhotozLSS11}.


\item {\it Selection in non-observables: } Two of the surveys comprising our
training set have selections in observables that are not included in the SDSS
magnitude limited sample.  As mentioned previously, the DEEP2-nonEGS sample is
selected using BRI photometry to target galaxies above $z>0.7$.  As shown in
\citet{CunhaPhotoz09}, the use of DEEP2 in earlier versions of this catalog
would cause a bump in the overall estimated redshift distribution around $z\sim
0.8$.  The present data release has a brighter magnitude cut and additional
training data, which has eliminated this bias.  
Now, DEEP2-nonEGS carries about 1.4\% of the total weight.  The 2SLAQ sample targets
LRG's.  Besides SDSS magnitudes, it also uses morphological information in the
selection.  Because shape correlates poorly with redshift, biases due to the
2SLAQ sample are expected to be small.  2SLAQ is an important part of our
sample because it provides a good training set for LRG's at higher redshift
than the SDSS sample.

\item {\it Spectroscopic failures: } The impact of spectroscopic failures is the
most difficult to quantify.  We chose a bright r-magnitude cut, and relatively
stringent cuts on spectroscopic quality to minimize effects of failures, but it
is possible that errors due to spectroscopic failures are not negligible.
% but it
%is possible that some features seen in the redshift distribution - such as the
%dip around $z=0.4$ are due partly to spectroscopic failures.
%{\color{red} this seems speculative, can we say anything quantitative?  If not
%perhaps simplify the comment to ``it is possible that there are significant
%errors due to spectroscopic failures''.}

\item {\it Star-galaxy separation? Discuss it here or somewhere else? {\color{red} I'm
looking into the expected contamination.  It's OK of course if there are stars as long as they
pile up at zero redshift!}}

\item {\it Seeing: } Nakajima et al (2011, in prep), point out that differences
between the seeing distribution of the galaxies in the photometric and the
training set can lead to biases in the photo-z error calibration.  In figure
\ref{fig:seeing} we show the seeing distributions for all of our photometric
sample compared to the four highest weight training samples other than SDSS.
The distributions are qualitatively similar, but with a trend to better seeing
for the training set matches.  More quantitatively, we checked the sensitivity
of our results to seeing-induced biases by including seeing as a variable in
the weights estimation.  We find only negligible change in the recovered
redshift distribution.  So, although differences in seeing are in general a
concern, we find little effect in our data.

\section{Proper Use} \label{sec:usage}

In this section we describe the proper use of these redshift distributions.
We risk an overly pedantic discussion here in order to ensure that past
mistakes are not repeated by the uninitiated.

If one desires to use the \pofz\ to evaluate any non-linear function $F(z)$,
one must integrate over the entire distribution; i.e. one must take the
expectation value.  The reason is quite simple. In general a function evaluated
at the expectation value of z does not equal the expectation value of the
function:
\begin{equation}
\langle F(z) \rangle \ne F(\langle z \rangle).
\end{equation}
The expectation value of the function should be computed as follows:
\begin{equation}
\langle F \rangle = \int_{0}^{\infty} F(z) P(z) dz.
\end{equation}
It is {\bf not} correct to simply take the mean of \pofz\ and use it to evaluate
a function.

This is true in most interesting science cases.  An excellent example is in
gravitational lensing, where one must estimate the ``critical density''
$\Sigma_{crit}$, which determines the strength of a given lens-source pair or
population.  The function $\Sigma_{crit}$ depends on the angular diameters
distance to lens, source and between lens and source in a non-linear way.  The
proper estimator for a lens at redshift $z_{l}$ and source with $P(z_s)$ is
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{crit}(z_l) = \int_{0}^{\infty} \Sigma_{crit}(z_l, z_s) P(z_s) dz_s.
\end{equation}



\subsection{\pofz\ and galaxy-galaxy lensing: proof-of-principle} \label{sec:pofp}

Particular analysis techniques may be more sensitive to the width of \pofz\ or
other properties of \pofz\ or \Nofz.  As an example we use the calibration
analysis of \citet{man08}, which is designed to estimate how much possible
bias in a lensing measurement may occur when using these types of \pofz.

We took the DEEP2-EGS sample to be both the training and photometric samples,
so the sample variance in this case is much higher than our data, and the
\pofz\ much broader.  But by construction the weights yield a virtually perfect
estimate, $\nwei$, of the redshift distribution of the photometric sample,
$\nphot$; thus errors are due to details of individual \pofz\ and the analysis
method. The calculated bias is shown in \ref{fig:simplebias}. In this case,
because the training set is so small, the $\npz$ differs significantly from the
$\nwei$ and this produces a small non-zero bias in the plot.  Note, we do apply
Eq. \ref{eqn:pzcorrect} to correct the \pofz s, so any resulting bias is
addition to that.  

Additionally, the bottom panel of Fig. \ref{fig:simplebias} shows the variance
of the measurement relative to that using perfect redshifts.  This demonstrates
the degradation in the errors when using data with finite width \pofz.

Although this analysis is simplified, it demonstrates the type of checks
that should be performed when using these data.

\begin{figure} [h]\centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/pz.egs.c3.paper.ps}

    \caption{Top panel: Proof of concept analysis of errors in a fictitious
    lensing analysis.  For this example we used only DEEP2-EGS galaxies but
    perfect weights estimate; the sample variance, and width of individual
    \pofz, are much larger than our sample, so this is a worse case scenario.
    Even with perfect weights and \Nofz\ recovery, lensing can be sensitive to
    the details of the individual \pofz.  Bottom panel: Noise in the lensing
    measurement relative to an analysis using the true redshifts.  A similar
    analysis could be performed for any measurement using the \pofz.

\section{Acquiring the Data}

{\color{red} Give the data model and location  of files on DR8 website. }

\section{Summary}

In this paper we presented a catalog of redshift probability distributions for
the SDSS DR8.  This catalog uses the same method as the \pofz\ catalog for SDSS
DR7 presented in \cite{CunhaPhotoz09} with some modifications.  For this
catalog, we use the ubercal photometry.  We also add the PRIMUS galaxy sample,
which more than doubles the number of galaxies in our training set that are
drawn from a flux-limited sample other than SDSS.  The addition of PRIMUS
provides a significant increase in the total area of the training set, which
helps to reduce sample variance.  We examined several potential sources of
error, including shot noise, sample variance, seeing, star-galaxy separation,
and spectroscopic failures.  We expect that sample variance is the main source
of uncertainty in our overall redshift distribution.  For individual \pofz s,
shot-noise is the limiting uncertainty.  Differently from the DR7 catalog, we
did not use repeat observations of our training set galaxies.  The use of
repeats can provide more localized and smoother \pofz\ estimates, and are often
useful.  However, because only part of our sample had repeat observations, the
use of repeats would effectively increase the sample variance of our results.
The use of repeats may be beneficial for LRGs because the training set is not
sample variance limited in this case.  We may release a catalog trained on
repeat observations at a future date.
