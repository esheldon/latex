The Bayesian gravitational shear estimation algorithm developed by Bernstein
and Armstrong (2014) can potentially be used to overcome noise bias and
recover shear using very low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) galaxy images.  In
that work the authors confirmed the method is sufficiently unbiased for
planned surveys (fractional error less than 2 x 10^{-3}) in a simplified
demonstration, but no test was performed on images with realistic pixel noise.
Here I present a full implementation for fitting models to galaxy images,
including the effects of a point spread function (PSF) and pixelization.  I
tested the implementation using simulated galaxy images modeled as Sersic
profiles with n=1 (exponential) and n=4 (De Vaucouleurs'), convolved with a
PSF and a flat pixel response function.  I used a round Gaussian model for the
PSF to avoid potential PSF-fitting errors.  I simulated galaxies with mean
observed, post-PSF full-width at half maximum equal to approximately 1.2 times
that of the PSF, with log-normal scatter.  I also drew fluxes from a
log-normal distribution. I produced independent simulations, each with pixel
noise tuned to produce different mean S/N ranging from 10-1000.  I applied a
constant shear to all images.  I fit the simulated images to a model with the
true Sersic index to avoid modeling biases.  I recovered the input shear with
fractional error less than 2 x 10^{-3} in all cases, confirming that, in these
controlled conditions, the method is sufficiently unbiased for planned
surveys.
